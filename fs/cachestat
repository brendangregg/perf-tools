# cachestat - show Linux page cache hit/miss statistics.
#             Uses Linux ftrace.
#
# This is a proof of concept using Linux ftrace capabilities on older kernels,
# and works by using function profiling for in-kernel counters. Specifically,
# four kernel functions are traced:
#
#	mark_page_accessed() for measuring cache accesses
#	mark_buffer_dirty() for measuring cache writes
#	add_to_page_cache_lru() for measuring page additions
#	account_page_dirtied() for measuring page dirties
#
# It is possible that these functions have been renamed (or are different
# logically) for your kernel version, and this script will not work as-is.
# This script was written on Linux 3.13. This script is a sandcastle: the
# kernel may wash some away, and you'll need to rebuild.
#
# USAGE: cachestat [-Dht] [interval]
#    eg,
#        cachestat 5	# show stats every 5 seconds
#
# Run "cachestat -h" for full usage.
#
# WARNING: This uses dynamic tracing of kernel functions, and could cause
# kernel panics or freezes. Test, and know what you are doing, before use.
# It also traces cache activity, which can be frequent, and cost some overhead.
# The statistics should be treated as best-effort: there may be some error
# margin depending on unusual workload types.
#
# REQUIREMENTS: CONFIG_FUNCTION_PROFILER, awk.
