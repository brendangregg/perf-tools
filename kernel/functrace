# functrace - trace kernel function calls matching specified wildcards.
#             Uses Linux ftrace.
#
# This is a proof of concept using Linux ftrace capabilities on older kernels.
#
# USAGE: functrace [-hH] [-p PID] [-d secs] funcstring
#    eg,
#        functrace '*sleep'	# trace all functions ending in "sleep"
#
# Run "functrace -h" for full usage.
#
# The output format is the same as the ftrace function trace format, described
# in the kernel source under Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt.
#
# The "-d duration" mode leaves the trace data in the kernel buffer, and
# only reads it at the end. If the trace data is large, beware of exhausting
# buffer space (/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb) and losing data.
#
# Also beware of feedback loops: tracing tcp* functions over an ssh session,
# or writing ext4* functions to an ext4 file system. For the former, tcp
# trace data could be redirected to a file (as in the usage message). For
# the latter, trace to the screen or a different file system.
#
# WARNING: This uses dynamic tracing of kernel functions, and could cause
# kernel panics or freezes. Test, and know what you are doing, before use.
#
# OVERHEADS: This can generate a lot of trace data quickly, depending on the
# frequency of the traced events. Such data will cause performance overheads.
# This also works without buffering by default, printing function events
# as they happen (uses trace_pipe), context switching and consuming CPU to do
# so. If needed, you can try the "-d secs" option, which buffers events
# instead, reducing overhead. If you think the buffer option is losing events,
# try increasing the buffer size (buffer_size_kb).
