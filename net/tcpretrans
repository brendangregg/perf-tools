# tcpretrans - show TCP retransmts, with address and other details.
#              Written using Linux ftrace.
#
# This traces TCP retransmits, showing address, port, and TCP state information,
# and sometimes the PID (although usually not, since retransmits are usually
# sent by the kernel on timeouts). To keep overhead low, only
# tcp_retransmit_skb() calls are traced (this does not trace every packet).
#
# USAGE: ./tcpretrans [-hls]
#
# REQUIREMENTS: FTRACE and KPROBE CONFIG, tcp_retransmit_skb() kernel function,
# and tcp_send_loss_probe() when -l is used. You may have these already have
# these on recent kernels. And Perl.
#
# This was written as a proof of concept for ftrace, for older Linux systems,
# and without kernel debuginfo. It uses dynamic tracing of tcp_retransmit_skb(),
# and reads /proc/net/tcp for socket details. Its use of dynamic tracing and
# CPU registers is an unstable platform-specific workaround, and may require
# modifications to work on different kernels and platforms. This would be better
# written using a tracer such as SystemTap, and will likely be rewritten in the
# future when certain tracing features are added to the Linux kernel.
#
# When -l is used, this also uses dynamic tracing of tcp_send_loss_probe() and
# a register.
#
# Currently only IPv4 is supported, on x86_64. If you try this on a different
# architecture, you'll likely need to adjust the register locations (search
# for %di).
#
# OVERHEAD: The CPU overhead is relative to the rate of TCP retransmits, and is
# designed to be low as this does not examine every packet. Once per second the
# /proc/net/tcp file is read, and a buffer of retransmit trace events is
# retrieved from the kernel and processed.
